## Introduction
## Purpose
The purpose of this document is to provide a comprehensive specification for Empathy Buddy, an AI-powered emotional-support and mood-matching chat platform. It outlines the system’s functional requirements, non-functional requirements, constraints, user interactions, and expected behaviors.
This document serves as a foundational reference for designers, developers, testers, project managers, and stakeholders who require a clear understanding of how the system should operate and the outcomes it must achieve.
By defining system expectations early, this specification ensures:
-A unified interpretation of the project goals
-Reduced ambiguity throughout the development cycle
-Measurable performance standards for testing, validation, and risk assessment
-A stable baseline for future upgrades
-Continued alignment with ethical, technical, and user-centered standards

## Scope
Empathy Buddy is an anonymous digital platform designed to promote emotional well-being by enabling users to connect with others who share similar or complementary moods. Users express their feelings by selecting from a curated set of mood emojis, which act as input for the platform’s intelligent matching engine.
If no suitable human match is available, the system automatically deploys an integrated Gemini-powered AI chatbot to provide empathetic, context-aware responses—ensuring that no user is left without support.
The platform prioritizes:
-Privacy and confidentiality
-Minimal data collection
-Transparent emotional-data processing
-Safe, non-clinical emotional support

Empathy Buddy is not a medical or therapeutic tool; instead, it serves as a supportive companion for emotional expression and connection. The system incorporates ethical AI principles, including fairness, transparency, responsible data handling, and well-being safeguards to ensure safe, respectful interactions.
